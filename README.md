libft  of 42 cusus 

- ft_memset.c =[x] -> change memory value to your desire
- ft_bzero.c = [x] -> add a '\0' to a lenght of value
- ft_memcpy.c = [x] -> copy the lenght of wanted
- ft_memccpy.c = [x] -> copy the lenght of wanted or until it find x
- ft_memmove.c = [x] -> copy a part of memory while not caring  if there a overlap
- ft_memchr.c = [x] -> find where the location of a byte by return a ptr to the first occurence
- ft_memcmp.c = [x] -> compare the data of each seq if positive first bigger else smaller
- ft_strlen.c = [x] -> lenght of string
- ft_strlcpy.c = [x] -> copy to newstring while adding what is possible;
- ft_strlcat.c = [x]  -> append to a   sring the part it can
- ft_strchr.c = [x]    -> return a ptr to the first instance of a char;
- ft_strrchr.c = [x] -> return a ptr of the last instance of a char;
- ft_strnstr.c = [x] -> find the first instance of said string;
- ft_strncmp.c =[x]  -> compare the substring of x with y if x contain y return a ptr to that said location
- ft_atoi.c = [x]    -> take a string and return a int with the depend sign from said string plus or  minus..
- ft_isalpha.c = [x] -> look if the char is alpha
- ft_isdigit.c = [x] -> look if the char is a digit 1-9
- ft_isalnum.c = [x]  -> look for number and ascii char to a-z-A-Z;
- ft_isascii.c = [x]  -> look it char is in the ascii table
- ft_isprint.c = [x]  -> look if char is printable or not;
- ft_toupper.c = [x]  -> take char to upper case if its not already...;
- ft_tolower.c = [x] -> same as the other one but lower case
- ft_calloc.c = [x]   -> allow memory while setting memory to there better implemenatation out there
- ft_strdup.c = [x] -> take string and return the same string in different memory adress wih a ptr might
return null if there too litte memory or the lenght of the string is zero..
- ft_substr.c = [] -> take index and copy until the end aka \0 or the said lenght as param
- ft_strjoin.c = [x] -> take list of string and add seperator beteween each;
- ft_strtrim.c = [x] -> remove a at front a set of char at front and at the end and return tethe this sequence
- ft_split.c = [x]-> take a string with a sep "a single char" into  **ptr;
- ft_itoa.c = [x]-> convert a nbr to a string using malloc like putnbr but to a string
- ft_strmapi.c = [x] -> make a duplicate of a string and then apply a fn to to these elems.
- ft_putstr_fd.c = [x] -> add a str to a file
- ft_putendl_fd.c = [x]-> add a str end a nbr to a file
- ft_putnbr_fd.c = [x] -> add a nbr to a file
